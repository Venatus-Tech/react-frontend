      "It was February and though general elections were far away the Election Committee wanted to raise awareness among college students, the importance of voting. Venatus was one of the only five societies to have been funded by the Election Commission itself for the event. The event was held at the Admin block and had various intriguing games such as an election based Jigsaw puzzle, blindfolded Word formation, Electionary which is basically Pictionary using specific election terms. But the highlight of our event was our Voting booth imitation which was kept at the main entrance of the Admin block, students could vote for their favourite superhero(as we were not allowed to take political partys’ names), covered with cafe curtains this beautiful setup attracted students in large numbers, those who voted had a fake electoral ink applied to their forefingers and gave a proper Election vibe. This event was an instant success, we are applauded by various teachers and we promised that we would never shy away in the future to take up such opportunities to show what Venatus can do as a society.",

The event spanned over four days from April 3 to April 6. A nominal entry fee was charged per each team. All the proceeds from the entry fees were donated for the pious cause.Cognisant of the social distancing during this lockdown we made sure that all the games were played online. The participation was huge, more than 400 players which makes up about 70 teams donated and played their favourite games online. An amount of ₹6200 was raised from the event which was transferred directly to the NGOs Uday foundation and Feeding India.We at VENATUS were delighted and enthralled to witness the sheer zeal and intensity with which the participants played the games and volunteered for the noble cause.By making this trivial yet honest effort, VENTAUS tends to exude a sense of belief by invigorating the helpless so that they may also feel secure and come up strong from this catastrophe.

Within a week the Alfresco members held their SIG and pulled it off amazingly well. Held in the nescii lawns at 12 in the noon you wouldn’t expect a lot to show up but a multitude of people showed up and played and enjoyed games expertly curated by the members. An unprecedented crowd of more than 300 appeared making this event of ours the most attended ever which set ‘some’ standards in terms of the level we have set for our events and how much effort we shall put in our future events to match the same level of success!",
